# Fake-News-Detection
This is a project for detecting Fake news using Natural Language Processing and Deep learning. 
Throughout the semester, we could train over different types of machine learning algorithms and found neural network algorithms to be the best in terms of accuracy. We have tried different types of hyperparameters of the network to achieve an acceptable result. We could reach 69% accuracy with our implementation, and 72% accuracy using the Sklearn MLP classifier. To be able to train words in a neural network, we used Skip gram Word2Vec to have numerical representation for each word. We believe that it is a good start to be able to improve the model further in the future. We use web applications as a bonus to clarify our idea of fake news.
